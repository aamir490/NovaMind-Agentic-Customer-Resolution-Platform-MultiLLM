POST /api/my/cases  — create a SupportCase for the authenticated customer

Security contract
-----------------
- customer_id is ALWAYS derived from the authenticated identity; it is never
  accepted from the request body (extra="forbid" on CustomerCaseCreate).
- Requires Role.CUSTOMER.
- Order ownership is verified through the existing Authorization mechanism
  before CaseService is called.
- The existing POST /api/cases (admin/staff) route is untouched.
